# Heroku Flask/JavaScript template

A template for a Heroku app with a Python Flask backend and a JavaScript frontend.

To use this to create a Heroku app, you will need to have Heroku installed ([instructions here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)).

1. Clone this repo into a directory.

2. In that directory, create the app:
```
heroku create NAME_OF_APP
```

3. Push to the app with:
```
git push heroku master
```

The app should now be running on Heroku.
